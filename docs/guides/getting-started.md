- Ensure all services are running (`docker-compose ps` or `kubectl get pods`)
- Common issues: missing dependencies, port conflicts, database connection errors

## Best Practices
- Use strong secrets and rotate API keys regularly
- Run tests before deploying to production
- Monitor resource usage and set up alerts
- Keep dependencies up to date
