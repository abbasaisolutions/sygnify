Additionally, rising interest rates (5.1%) and inflation (3.8%) may pose risks for borrowers, as increasing borrowing costs could be detrimental to their financial health.

The strong correlation between amount and balance (0.27) suggests a moderate association, warranting further investigation. Additionally, the sector index of 1585 with a volatility level of 0.27 indicates some level of market uncertainty. In light of these findings, I recommend considering refinancing or locking in fixed rates to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates. Further analysis is needed to better understand the relationship between amount and balance, but for now, it's essential to prioritize managing borrowing costs and maintaining financial stability."}
